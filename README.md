🎨 How to Customize Content
You don't need to be a coder to change the text and images. 90% of the site's content is managed in one file.

1. Changing Text (Menu, FAQs, Reviews, etc.)
   Open app/data.js. You will see lists of data. simply change the text inside the quotes.

Example - Changing a Menu Item:

JavaScript

export const menuItems = [
{
id: 1,
name: "My New Steak Name", // Change this
category: "Steaks",
price: "$55.00", // Change price
desc: "Description of your new dish...",
},
// ...
]; 2. Changing Images
Go to the public/images/ folder.

Replace the existing images with your own.

Tip: Keep the file names the same (e.g., hero-wood.jpg) to avoid changing code. If you use new names, update the path in app/data.js or app/page.js.

3. Changing the "Secret Menu" Code
   Want a different code word?

Open components/SecretMenu.js.

Find this line:

JavaScript

const secretCode = "SHADOW";
Change "SHADOW" to your restaurant name or any code (e.g., "VIP2026").

4. Changing Colors
   The site uses Tailwind CSS.

Open app/globals.css.

The "Gold" accent color is #FFD700. You can Find & Replace this hex code throughout the project to match your brand color.

🚢 Deployment (Vercel)
The easiest way to put this site online is with Vercel.

Push your code to a GitHub repository.

Go to Vercel.com and sign up.

Click "Add New Project" and select your GitHub repo.

Important: In the "Environment Variables" section on Vercel, add the same Keys you put in your .env.local file (Supabase and Resend keys).

Click Deploy.
